(C++) TwoDigitNewick algorithm
 
This page describes the algorith as used in the TwoDitNewick class.
 
1. Definitions
 
A 'simple Newick' denotes a Newick with two (or more) final branches, that is, a Newick in the form of '(X,Y,...)' 
(where all values are positive non-zero values), for example '(2,2)'. A 'complex newick' is a Newick that has branched with branches, that is a Newick in the form of ((X,Y),Z) (where X,Y and Z might be positive non-zero values or complex Newicks), for example '((2,2),2)'.
 
N1 denotes the Newick we want its probability calculated:
 
N1 = ((2,2),2)
 
L1 denotes the largest simple Newick found within the complex Newick N1:
 
L1 = (2,2)
 
A 'partially summizarized Newick', is a complex Newick that has one of its branches summarized, where the other branch contains an unsummarized value. In the example below, the Newick ((2,2),2)' becomes the partially summarized Newick '(8,2)', in which '8' is the summarized index of '(2,2)'. A 'completely summarized Newick' is a Newick that has both branches summarized. For example, the Newick ((2,2),(2,2)) becomes the completely summarized Newick '(8,8)'.
 
 
 
 
 
2. Index all simple Newicks
 
In this step all simple Newicks that will be encountered in the whole algorithm are indexed.
 
L1, the largest simple Newick found within N1, and its derivatives (which are all simple Newicks) are indexed:
 
Newick	Index
(0)	0
(1)	1
(2)	2
(3)	3
(4)	4
(5)	5
(2,2)	6 <- m_reserved == 6
(2,1)	7
(1,1)	8
 
Note that the indices are perhaps not ordered as expected. The values of these indices, however, do not matter: these are just identifiers for the Newicks.
 
The indices for the single-value Newicks must be indentical to the
The highest index of the Newicks stored must be remembered. In this case, an index of 5 or lower denotes a simple Newick. This value is called n_reserved.
 
 
 
 
 
3. summarize the complex Newick
 
In this step, the simple Newicks in N1 are replaced by their indices in the complex Newick.
 
N1 = ((2,2),2) -> (2,6)
 
In this example, this yields a partially summarized Newick, because the value of '2' denotes '2', where the value of '6' denotes '(2,2)'. Knowing if a value is itself or a summary of others is done by comparing it to n_reserved: all values below it (in this case the value of 6) are known to be themselves.
